# TF2-customizations
I use https://toonhud.com/user/soundsmith/theme/UJL3QMIP/ (I used FlawHUD before I moved to Linux), mastercomfig-ultra with no tutorials, custom cfg files and I'm still working on new things :)

To install FlawHUD mastercomfig move them into tf/custom folder
To install autoexec.cfg move it into tf/cfg, it will be automatically executed when the game launched. If you have another autoexec file rename it to autoexec2.cfg and it will be executed after autoexec.cfg. 
To install and run jump.cfg(used for training rocket jumping, sticky bombs jumping, pyro jumping, etc.) move it into tf/cfg, then after the game launched, start a server and select player class. After that write **exec jump** command in the console, and the script will run.
